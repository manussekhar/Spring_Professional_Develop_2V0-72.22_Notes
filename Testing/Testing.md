> Both the @MockBean and @Mock annotation can be used to create Mockito mocks but there are some differences between the two annotations: • @Mock can only be applied to fields and parameters while @MockBean can only be applied to classes and fields. • @Mock can be used to mock any Java class or interface while @MockBean only allows for mocking of Spring beans or creation of mock Spring beans. @MockBean can be used to mock existing beans but also to create new beans that will belong to the Spring application context. • To be able to use the @MockBean annotation, the Spring runner (@RunWith(SpringRunner.class) ) has to be used to run the associated test. • @MockBean can be used to create custom annotations for specific, reoccurring, needs When running Spring Boot Tests, both @Mock and @MockBean are included in the spring-boot-starter-test.
